# Supermarket-Sales-Dashboard using Power BI


***Introduction:***

The goal  of this project was to develop a comprehensive dashboard that provides actionable insights to drive business decisions and optimize sales performance.


The objective of the project was to design and develop an interactive sales visualization dashboard that enables stakeholders to gain insights into sales trends, product performance, customer demographics, and other key metrics. 

***Key Features:***

- Data Import: The project began with importing sample data into Power BI from Excel.

- Visualization Creation: A variety of visualizations were created to analyze different aspects of sales and customer behavior, including:
  - Sales distribution by branch and city using clustered column charts.
  - Customer demographics analysis using pie charts.
  - Product line performance visualization using bar charts.
  - Sales trends over time displayed using line charts.
  - Payment methods analysis using pie charts.
  - Average transaction value representation using DAX formulae (Avg Transaction Value = 'Sales'[Total] / 'Sales'[Quantity]) and line charts. 

- Interactivity: Interactive features such as cross-filtering and slicing were added to the visualizations to allow users to explore the data dynamically and gain deeper insights.
- Dashboard Creation: The individual visualizations were arranged into a cohesive dashboard layout, providing a high-level overview of key metrics while allowing users to drill down into specific details as needed.
